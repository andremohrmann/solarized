PuTTY Tray
----------

[PuTTY Tray](https://puttytray.goeswhere.com/) can store sessions in text files as opposed to the Windows registry. To modify an existing session to use Solarized colors, open the file in a text editor and replace the lines beginning with `Colour##` (0-21) with the version from `solarized_dark_puttytray.txt`.
